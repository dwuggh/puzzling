  - https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/896043488029600
  - there is no need to learn all these contents at once, here I list some useful git commands, which should be enough for beginner-use:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell

git clone
git checkout -b new_branch
git checkout exist_branch
git add
git stage
git commit
git push

  #+END_SRC
  - and if you use a graphical git client, like some vscode add-on or intellij's, then you can use your mouse. It can be both convenient and the opposite.
